When I first meet Richard Stallman, I was anxious to thanks him to create emacs, he responded with the "obvious" but unexpected phrase, "Oh that's good, Emacs love all the users"

I started using emacs in 2011, my greatest friend Lincoln Clarete (@clarete) show me this beloved "editor" while we work together. In this time I was a happy Vim user, until I see this automagically indent with Tab for html code. It was just a begining of my love stories with emacs, to be honest my storie with emacs is a story of a friendship too. Me and Lincoln has a lot of things in common and I had the pleasure of sharig with him a room, workplace, city and lot of other things we like, Emacs is one of them, I started using his emacs config and after sometime I started to make small changes and today we have configurations like children of same parents, came from the same place but each one has it's own personality. Discovery and learn new things became part of our relationship, we don't share roof anymore, neighter workplace and country, but we share this amazing friendship and the love for emacs.
