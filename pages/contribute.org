#+TITLE: Tell your tale
#+SLUG: contribute

This website was inspired by awesome and exciting tales I saw frequently on emacs subreddit[fn:1]. I believe share this personal
experiences makes the emacs experience more human and helps we develop ourselves and our emacs skills together.

Feel free to share you tale with us [[https://github.com/emacs-love/tales][opening a pull request]] or sending your story to [[mailto:tales@emacs.love][tales@emacs.love]].
