#+TITLE: Emacs love domain
#+DATE: <2021-02-02>

After deciding to buy the emacs.love domain, I was excited to
start using my fresh and loved domain, but after pushing my first
draft to Github Pages, I get another website showing up.  After a
bit of debugging I realize, there was I not the first to have
that idea and someone else had a Github Pages site with the same
domain.

Long story short, we buy a domain that the old owner didn't
renew, but keep the repository with the CNAME.  Fortunately I
could get in touch and get a quick and lovely reply:

Brilliant. I'm super happy someone bought the domain for good use. I've removed it from my github so feel free to configure it.

Moments like this makes my heart laugh and I feel so joyful and remembers me that [[url_for:tale,slug=emacs-loves-all-its-users
