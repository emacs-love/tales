    Emacs love all the users

When I first met Richard Stallman, I was anxious to thank him for
creating Emacs, he responded with the "obvious" but unexpected
phrase, "Oh that's good, Emacs loves all its users"
</p>

<p>
I started using Emacs back in 2011, my greatest friend Lincoln
Clarete (<a href="http://clarete.li">@clarete</a>) shown me this lovely "editor" while we worked
together. At this time, I was a happy Vim user, until I saw HTML
code automagically indented with Tab. It was just the beginning
of my love story with Emacs.
</p>

<p>
My story with Emacs is a story of a friendship too. Lincoln and
I have a lot of things in common and I had the pleasure of
sharing with him our home, workplace, city and lot of other
things we like, Emacs is one of them. I started using his Emacs
config and after sometime I started to make small changes and
today we have configurations like children of same parents, came
from the same place but each one has it's own personality.
</p>

<p>
Discovery and learning new things became part of our
relationship, we don't share a roof anymore, neither workplace
nor country, but we share this amazing friendship and the love
for Emacs.
